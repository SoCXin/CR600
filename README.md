## [简介](https://github.com/sochub/CM7/wiki)

The ARM® Cortex®-M7 processor is the most recent and highest performance member of the energy-efficient ARM Cortex-M series, enabling partners to build the most sophisticated variety of MCUs and embedded SoCs. The Cortex-M7 has been designed to deliver a very high level of performance, while maintaining the excellent responsiveness and ease-of-use of the ARMv7-M architecture.

Highest performance Cortex-M processor delivering the best in class integer, floating point and DSP performance
Low-power processor design with extensive clock and power gating, customizable to minimize power consumption and high energy efficiency
Flexible system and memory interfaces including AXI, AHB, caches and tightly-coupled memories
Safety-critical requirement support, with features like the error recovery through memory Error Correction Code (ECC), full data trace, and full safety documentation
C friendly programmer’s model and 100% binary compatible with existing Cortex-M3 and Cortex-M4 processors
